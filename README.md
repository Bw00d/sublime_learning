##Sublime Learning in Rails!

###Epicodus bootcamp build anything you want exercise

The objective of this exercise is to build an application that will help you practice Sublime Text 2 keyboard shortcuts. 

####Status:

* I am able to create lessons.  Each lesson has a name, chapter id, content - which is inputted as markdown and retrieved with the <a href="https://github.com/vmg/redcarpet">redcarpet</a> gem so it can be styled, an editable code block -  also markdown, and an answer code block which will be used to compare the result of the user input.
* The <a heref="">ace editor</a> is embedded and will allow the user to practice editing the editable code block.


####Todo

* The ace editor claims to have fully customizable key-binding and I am researching how to add the Sublime Text key-bindings to my app.
* I will bw using the <a href="https://github.com/kugaevsky/mousetrap-rails">mousetrap-rails</a> gem to record the users keystrokes to test for efficient editing.
