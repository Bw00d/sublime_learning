##Sublime Learning in Rails!

###Epicodus bootcamp build anything you want eexercise

The objective of this exercise is to build an application that will help you practice Sublime Text 2 keyboard shortcuts. Some of the functionality is well beyond my abilities but I will approach it agilely and add complicated functionality as I figure it out.

My objectives:

* First, work on CRUD/L functionality for lessons. A lesson has a name and some text content and a lesson number. This will include an admin page for creating lessons.

* Next, the lessons need to be viewed sequentially. When you click Next lesson at the bottom of the page, it goes to the lesson with the next-highest number.

* Then, the lessons need to be grouped by category. For example, Delete: 1 Delete line, 2 Delete to end of line, 3 Delete to beginning of line.

* Of course we will use test driven development throughout.
